datacite-metadata-generator
===========================

This is a single HTML form which can be used to generate DataCite Metadata Kernel 4.3 XML. 

Metadata generator software is based on [Marcin Paluch's](https://github.com/mpaluch/datacite-metadata-generator). Recent updates and new design implemented by [Osman Cakir](https://github.com/osmancakir).
Metadata is generated by populating text boxes and selecting values from drop-downs. The results can then be saved to a file. The main goal of this form was to create a tool which does not require any installation, extra libraries, or an application server, just download and go.
